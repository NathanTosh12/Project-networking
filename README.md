# Project-networking

I have found this project to be fairly difficult. At first I had to get used to github and it's various commits. That had got me stuck for a bit until I did some more research into

how github works. Then the next step was figuring out how to stop the error code with Vercel. Error code 404 kept happenning and that was frustrating. At this point in time I have not learned

how to resolve this issue. I'm looking into if I was putting the wrong links in, or if I was putting in commands in the wrong directory. I will see how that goes.

Some things I learned were that it was my first time using ipstack.com. That was interesting and I can see there is way more to use it with than what I saw during this lab.

Another thing I learned is that vercel can be kind of difficult to troubleshoot. I'm not sure if it's due to my inexperience with troubleshooting, or if it would be the fault of vercel,

but I think it is my fault in the end.

I believe that 2 different IP addresses show because vercel has a built in public I.P address and the P.C also has it's own public I.P address set on it.
